# GameBoy MemoryBackup Homebrew Application

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a usable application for my another project [Gameboy MemoryBackup Cartridge](https://github.com/SONIC3D/gameboy-memorybackup). As it's an enhanced version of the original Karat MemoryBackup(also known as "Mega Memory" or "Mega Memory Card" in other regions), this project will start from reversing and reimplementing the original "Mema Memory" program features.

## Special Thanks
* The original Mega Memory Card creators and publisher for their great product.
* All the creators of [GameBoy PanDocs](https://problemkaputt.de/pandocs.htm).
* BGB emulator team for their great emulator.
* People behind the Hex Rays IDA disassembler.
* The [RGBDS GameBoy development toolchains](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/).
* The makefile of this project is based on the project [gb-boilerplate](https://github.com/ISSOtm/gb-boilerplate)
