# GameBoy MemoryBackup Homebrew Application

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a usable application for my another project [Gameboy MemoryBackup Cartridge](https://github.com/SONIC3D/gameboy-memorybackup). As it's an enhanced version of the original Karat MemoryBackup(also known as "Mega Memory" or "Mega Memory Card" in other regions), this project will start from reversing and reimplementing the original "Mema Memory" program features.
